# Hey there! 
This is my first repository on GitHub! #noob

I am a Rhode Island-born, first street in Connecticut outside of Rhode Island-raised girl. I moved to Atlanta, Georgia in November 2015, after living in Washington, DC for eight years. While in DC, I graduated from Washington, DC with a Bachelor of Arts in Justice - my concentration was Criminology and I minored in Communications. Up until very recently I thought I wanted to be a lawyer, but now I think I was made for something less stuffy, more creative. I love writing and coordinating, so I'm following that passion and running with it. 
Wish me luck!
